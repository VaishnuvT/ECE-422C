I would like to improve my skill in Java, especially writing clean, efficient, and well-structured object-oriented code. I would like to be instructed in good software engineering practices such as testing, debugging, and design patterns that will prepare me for larger projects. If there is time towards the end of the semester, I would love to learn more advanced Java topics such as concurrency, functional programming features (streams and lambdas), and industry practices such as version control and build automation.
